# JobAssessment
An assessment for a company I was interviewing for using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript

## The prompt is as follows: 

Please recreate this image using HTML and CSS, without using any class names in the CSS in JS Fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net. Then please send us the link to JS Fiddle you created. 

Image

As a bonus, fade each rectangle out (one at a time with a delay) using Javascript when the Hello world! element is clicked.


Again, this is simply a test of your HTML/CSS/JS skills. Please take as long as youâ€™d like on it, and let us know if you have any questions or concerns.
